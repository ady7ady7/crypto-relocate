    // Detailed description
    description: 'Mauritius does not impose capital gains tax on individuals for investments, including cryptocurrency if treated as capital gains. However, if crypto trading is frequent, it may be taxed as business income at 15-53%. There\'s no wealth tax. Residency through the Residency by Investment Program requires a minimum investment of USD 375,000 in approved real estate projects or businesses, with no initial physical presence needed, and processing typically takes 2-3 months. Citizenship involves maintaining residency for seven years (five for Commonwealth countries) or two years with a USD 500,000 investment for fast-track naturalization, taking 12-18 months to process. Banks like Monzo and Revolut offer crypto-friendly services, while traditional banks are generally neutral. The DeFi market is projected to grow to US$1,513.0k by 2027. The economy is stable with diversified sectors, with inflation expected to moderate to 4.9% in 2024 from a high of 10.8% in 2022. The cost of living is 42.5% lower than in the United States, with a family of four spending around $2,215 monthly without rent.'
