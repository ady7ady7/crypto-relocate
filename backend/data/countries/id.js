  // Detailed description
  description: 'Indonesia imposes a 0.1% income tax on capital gains and a 0.11% Value-Added Tax (VAT) on each cryptocurrency transaction, effective since May 2022. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term gains, and tax is based on the transaction value rather than profit. As of January 2025, regulation of cryptocurrencies has shifted from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) to the Financial Services Authority (OJK), creating space for banks to explore services such as crypto custody and blockchain-based solutions. There are no widely recognized crypto-friendly banks, though the OJK\'s new regulations may encourage future development. Institutional custody solutions are available through PT Kustodian Koin Indonesia (ICC), approved in 2023. Indonesia offers a Second Home Visa requiring minimum savings of $129,000 for a 10-year stay, with no physical presence needed beyond the initial application. Permanent residency requires continuous residence for at least 3 years, while citizenship through naturalization takes 5-10 years. The country does not have a wealth tax. Indonesia\'s economy is stable with inflation projected to remain within the target range of 3.0% ±1%, and the banking system is regulated by Bank Indonesia with no specific issues noted. The cost of living is low, with an index of 26.7 compared to the U.S. at 100.'
