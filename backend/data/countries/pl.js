  // Detailed description
  description: 'Poland applies a flat 19% tax rate on profits from converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. Crypto-to-crypto trades, mining/staking rewards (until converted to fiat), and airdrops/forks are tax-free, providing flexibility for traders. There is no wealth tax. Tax reporting is managed through the PIT-38 form annually, with the filing deadline typically between February 15 and April 30. Traditional banks like ING and PKO Bank Polski tolerate personal cryptocurrency transactions but restrict business services, reflecting regulatory caution. There are no specifically crypto-friendly banks, but some banks are more accommodating for personal use. Global institutional custody solutions are accessible to Polish users, although no specific local providers are documented. DeFi access is primarily through international platforms like Uniswap, with limited local integrations. Temporary residence permits are required for stays over 90 days and can be converted to permanent residency after continuous legal residence for at least 3 years. Citizenship via naturalization requires at least 3 years of residency based on a permanent residence permit, with proof of integration including Polish language proficiency. Poland allows dual citizenship. The economy is stable with GDP growth of 2.4% in 2024, and inflation is expected to normalize around 2.3% by early 2025. The cost of living is 35.5% lower than in the United States.'
