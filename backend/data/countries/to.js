  // Detailed description
  description: 'Tonga does not impose a capital gains tax on cryptocurrency disposals under existing laws. However, a 5% flat tax on non-business crypto gains was proposed in 2024 but remains unapproved. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, crypto gains could be taxed as ordinary income if classified as business activity, though no enforcement precedents exist. The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) warns crypto transactions lack legal protections but confirms no tax framework is in place. Traditional banks like MBF Bank and BSP block crypto transactions under AML/CFT policies, with no Tongan banks providing crypto services. Users rely on Binance P2P for TOP↔crypto conversions and Pursa for anonymous BTC↔USD transactions via bank transfers. Global brokers like Interactive Brokers (4 cryptos), MultiBank (23 cryptos), and Oanda (18 cryptos) facilitate AUD↔crypto conversions. Tonga lacks domestic custodians, forcing users to turn to global options like Fireblocks and Tangem hardware wallets. The RexoSwap Partnership launched a Bitcoin payment pilot for merchants in January 2025, while the Digital Kina CBDC is in exploratory phase under NRBT. Tonga imposes no wealth tax on crypto holdings. The country showed 5.4% GDP growth in 2024 with 4.2% inflation. Crypto investors face a 20-30% premium for expat housing, with average monthly salaries around TOP 1,800 ($700).'
