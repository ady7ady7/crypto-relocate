  // Detailed description
  description: 'Egypt currently taxes capital gains on unlisted shares at progressive income tax rates from 0% to 25%, while listed shares are subject to a 10% capital gains tax. For cryptocurrencies, Egypt has implemented a ban through the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the Central Bank and Banking System Law (Law No. 194 of 2020), making all dealings, including issuance, trading, promotion, and operating platforms, illegal. Therefore, there is no legal framework for taxing cryptocurrency gains, though if reported illegally, they might theoretically be taxed under general income tax laws. Traditional banks do not offer any cryptocurrency services due to the ban. Despite the ban, unofficial estimates suggest over 3 million Egyptians use cryptocurrencies. There is no wealth tax. Foreigners can apply for residency with investment thresholds around $50,000 plus monthly income of $2,500, while citizenship through naturalization requires at least 10 years of continuous residence, Arabic proficiency, and good character. Dual citizenship is generally allowed. Egypt\'s economy is undergoing reforms with a comprehensive strategy for 2024-2030, aiming to stabilize macroeconomic fundamentals with growth projected to reach 4.2% by FY2026. Inflation is currently high at around 25% but targeted to reach single digits by the end of 2025. The cost of living is 70.6% lower than in the United States.'
