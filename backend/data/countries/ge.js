    // Detailed description
    description: 'Georgia offers 0% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency for tax residents, with a territorial taxation system that exempts non-Georgian source income. The High Net Worth Individual (HNWI) program requires proven wealth of GEL 3,000,000 (approximately €970,000) or annual income of GEL 200,000, and assets in Georgia valued at least $500,000 USD. Alternatively, investment options include $100,000 in real estate or $300,000 in other investments, with minimal physical presence (7 days/year on average) and processing takes 2-3 months. Citizenship involves 10 years of residency, Georgian language proficiency, and takes 7-18 months to process. TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia offer crypto-friendly services, though institutional custody and DeFi integration are limited. The economy is stable with projected inflation rates of 3.0% (2024), 2.8% (2025), and 2.5% (2026), and the cost of living is 53.4% lower than the US, with rent for a one-bedroom in Tbilisi at $300-$500/month.'
