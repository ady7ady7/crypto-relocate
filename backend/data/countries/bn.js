  // Detailed description
  description: 'Brunei does not impose a capital gains tax, meaning profits from selling assets, including cryptocurrencies, are not taxable. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term gains, and no specific reporting requirements for crypto transactions exist, given the lack of regulation. Traditional banks in Brunei, like BIBD and Baiduri Bank, do not offer cryptocurrency services, as the government advises caution. However, international platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Remitano allow users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies using bank transfers. The lack of local DeFi infrastructure poses risks for adoption and compliance, with users navigating international platforms at their own risk. Brunei has no wealth tax for general assets or cryptocurrencies, with no taxes on net wealth, property, or inheritance. There are no formal residency by investment programs, with permanent residence typically obtained through marriage to a Bruneian or conventional immigration. The country\'s small economy and lack of cryptocurrency regulation mean that institutional investors would need to use international custody providers. The economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas, contributing about 50% to GDP, with solid external buffers despite recent challenges. The cost of living is 31.7% lower than in the United States, with rent 60.5% lower.'
