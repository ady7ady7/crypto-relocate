  // Detailed description
  description: 'Peru currently taxes crypto gains as income at progressive rates from 8% to 35%, with proposed reforms to classify crypto gains under a new "Capital Income" framework taxed at 20-30% by late 2025. Traditional banks don\'t directly support crypto, although Fluyez launched in 2022 as Peru\'s first cryptocurrency bank, allowing users to buy, sell, and hold over 60 cryptocurrencies. Global custody providers like Bit2Me Custody and Kraken Institutional are accessible to Peruvian users, while DeFi integration remains limited with no formal regulation. There is no wealth tax. Residency options include a Rentista Visa requiring monthly income of $1,000+ or an Investment Visa requiring at least $154,000, with 3 years of temporary residency before permanent status. Citizenship through naturalization requires at least 2 years of legal residence, knowledge of Spanish, good character, and renunciation of previous citizenship for adults. The economy is expected to grow by 3.1% in 2025, with historically low inflation under 2%. The cost of living is 53.8% lower than in the United States, with monthly expenses for a family of four around $1,856 without rent. In 2025, significant changes are expected with the implementation of new tax laws potentially applying retroactively from January 1, 2025.'
