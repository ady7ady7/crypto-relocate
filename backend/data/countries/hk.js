    // Detailed description
    description: 'Hong Kong does not impose capital gains tax on individuals for investments, including cryptocurrencies. However, if crypto trading is frequent, it may be considered business income, taxed at 8.25-16.5% for corporations and up to 15% for individuals. There is no wealth tax. Residency through the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) requires a HK$30 million ($3.8 million) investment, with cryptocurrency accepted as proof of wealth as of February 2025. No continuous physical presence is required for CIES, but applicants must demonstrate genuine investment. Hong Kong does not offer direct citizenship by investment, as citizenship is tied to Chinese nationality law. Permanent residency, granting the right of abode, can be obtained after 7 years of continuous residence. ZA Bank, Hong Kong\'s first and largest digital bank, has become Asia\'s first to offer crypto trading services for retail users, allowing trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum through its app. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued guidance for banks providing custodial services for digital assets. The economy is stable with GDP growth projected at 2.5% in 2025, and inflation at 2.9% in 2024. The cost of living is 13% above the US, with a single person\'s monthly costs at HK$20,411 with rent.'
