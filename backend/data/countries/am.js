  // Detailed description
  description: 'Armenia does not currently have a dedicated cryptocurrency tax framework, with conflicting interpretations regarding taxation. Some sources indicate potential 10% income tax on gains from foreign-issued digital assets, while others suggest 15% tax on other crypto disposals, treated as capital gains. The Law on Crypto Assets, adopted February 2025, allows Armenian banks to offer crypto services under MiCA-like frameworks, requiring AML/KYC compliance. A CBDC initiative called "Bokolo Cash" is under development for cross-border transactions. Licensed exchanges like Bynex, Whitebird, and Free2Ex operate under Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) oversight, while third-party platforms like Binance P2P dominate liquidity for AMD↔crypto conversions. Traditional banks await full regulatory clarity before launching crypto wallets. For institutional investors, global custodians like Fireblocks and ChainUp serve clients, though no domestic providers exist. Residency options include investment-based permits requiring $100k+ in high-tech sectors with processing taking 6-12 months. Citizenship typically requires 5+ years of continuous residence, basic Armenian language proficiency, and renunciation of other citizenships unless permitted. The economy is growing at 5.4% as of 2024, with 4.2% inflation in 2025. The cost of living is moderate, with one-bedroom apartments in city centers costing €200-400 monthly. A draft crypto framework is being developed, with full implementation expected to align with OECD\'s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework by 2027.'
