    // Detailed description
    description: 'Portugal offers 0% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency held for more than 365 days, while short-term gains (less than 365 days) are taxed at 28%. Professional traders face income tax rates of 14.5-53%, and passive income like staking is taxed at 28%. There is no wealth tax. The Golden Visa program requires a €250,000-€500,000 investment, with minimal physical presence (7 days/year on average) and processing takes 2-3 months. Citizenship involves maintaining residency for 5 years, passing a Portuguese language test (A2 level), and takes 7-18 months to process. Several Portuguese banks, including Santander Totta and Millennium BCP, offer crypto-friendly services. The economy is stable with projected inflation rates of 2.6% (2024), 2.1% (2025), and 1.9% (2026). The cost of living is 32.8% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around €2,773 monthly with rent. Important consideration: an exit tax of 29% applies to cryptocurrency assets when leaving Portugal.'
