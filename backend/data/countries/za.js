  // Detailed description
  description: 'South Africa taxes crypto gains at up to 18% for individuals, with an annual R40,000 exemption. There\'s no difference between long-term and short-term gains, and reporting is required for gains above the threshold, using the FIFO method. The SARS has a specialized crypto unit to crack down on tax evasion, issuing audit letters to investors. Traditional banks like Absa and FNB support crypto via exchanges like Luno, but don\'t offer direct services. Global custody providers like BitGo and Fireblocks serve institutional investors, while local DeFi options are limited, with users relying on global platforms like Uniswap. Residency requires five years on a work permit or R12 million net worth, with documents like police clearances. Citizenship takes five years of residency, needing good character and language skills. The economy is challenged by energy crises, with a new Government of National Unity formed in June 2024 focusing on economic recovery. The cost of living is 52.1% lower than the US, with a family of four needing around R38,028 monthly without rent.'
