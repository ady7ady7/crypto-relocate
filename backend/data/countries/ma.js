  // Detailed description
  description: 'Morocco taxes capital gains at a flat 20% rate, with no distinction between short-term and long-term gains. For cryptocurrencies, which are currently banned under Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) directives, there is no legal framework for taxation. However, a draft crypto law is in progress as of November 2024, which may integrate cryptocurrencies into the existing tax system. Morocco does impose a wealth tax of 0.5-1.5% on net worth over $100,000, though this does not currently apply to crypto due to the ban. Traditional banks do not offer banking services for cryptocurrencies, and there are no crypto-friendly banks legally operating in the country. Some global exchanges like Bybit and Binance allow Moroccan users to trade unofficially. There are no local institutional custody solutions or significant DeFi integrations due to the regulatory ban. Residency requires applying for a permit (Certificat d\'Immatriculation) with property investment typically starting at $50,000, while citizenship through naturalization requires 5 years of continuous residence, Arabic or French proficiency, and good character. The economy has demonstrated resilience despite challenges, with inflation generally kept under 2% in recent years. The cost of living is 56.2% lower than in the United States, making it affordable for visitors if cryptocurrency operations can be managed legally.'
