  // Detailed description
  description: 'Vanuatu does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. There is also no income tax, corporate tax, or wealth tax, though indirect taxes like a 17% VAT do apply. Permanent residency costs $7,450 for an individual and $9,900 for a family of four, with no physical presence required, and processing takes about 5 days, valid for 10 years and renewable. Citizenship by investment through the Development Support Program (VDSP) requires a $130,000 donation for a single applicant or $180,000 for a family of four, with no physical presence needed, and processing typically takes 1-3 months. Banks like ANZ Bank Vanuatu and Bred Bank Vanuatu allow indirect support for cryptocurrency transactions. The economy has maintained macroeconomic stability, with inflation at 7% in Q4 2023, forecasted to decrease to 4.8% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025. The cost of living is moderate, with monthly expenses for a single person around $2,500-$3,000 without rent. In 2024, a new Capital Investment Immigration Plan (CIIP) was introduced, costing $160,500 all-inclusive for a family of four, including a $50,000 investment in the Vanuatu Cocoa Sustainable Fund that is redeemable after four years.'
