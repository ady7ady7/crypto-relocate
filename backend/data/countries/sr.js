  // Detailed description
  description: 'Suriname does not have explicit cryptocurrency tax regulations as of March 2025. Profits from crypto disposals may be taxed as ordinary income under Suriname\'s Income Tax Act, with rates up to 38% for high-income earners, though presidential candidate Maya Parbhoe advocates for Bitcoin as legal tender and tax-free crypto transactions (pending legislation). No Surinamese banks offer crypto services, with banks like Hakrinbank blocking crypto transactions under AML/CFT policies. Users rely on platforms like Binance P2P (dominates SRD liquidity) and EasyEquities (low-fee platform supporting 62+ coins). Suriname lacks regulated custody providers and domestic DeFi infrastructure, requiring users to access global solutions like ChainUp Custody and BitGo. There is no wealth tax on crypto holdings. Temporary residency is granted for employment, study, or family reunification with processing times of 60-90 days. Citizenship requires 5+ continuous years of residency, basic Dutch proficiency, and mandatory renunciation of other citizenships unless permitted by origin country. The economy has seen inflation decrease to 4.2% (from 686% in 2022) with GDP growth of 2.3%. Crypto investors face a 30-50% premium for expat housing, with average monthly salaries around $180.'
