    // Detailed description
    description: 'Paraguay has no capital gains tax for private individuals on investments like stocks and bonds, including cryptocurrency if held as capital assets. If crypto trading is frequent or considered a business activity, it may be taxed at 10-20% for individuals and 10% for companies. There is no wealth tax. Residency through the SUACE program (Sistema Unificado de Apertura y Cierre de Empresas) requires a minimum investment of $70,000, which can be distributed over 10 years, with document renewal every 10 years and no initial physical presence needed. Processing time for permanent residency via SUACE is within 3 months. Citizenship requires 3 years of permanent residency with at least 183 days per year physical presence, passing exams in Spanish or Guarani, and knowledge of Paraguay politics and history. The financial infrastructure for crypto is emerging but limited. The economy is stable with nine consecutive years of budget surpluses over the past 12 years and a fiscal "golden rule" law limiting budget deficits to 1.5% of GDP. Inflation was 3.7% in 2023, expected to remain stable at 3.8% in 2024. The cost of living is 65.0% lower than in the United States.'
