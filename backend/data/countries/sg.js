    // Detailed description
    description: 'Singapore does not impose capital gains tax on individuals for cryptocurrency held as capital assets, but frequent trading may be considered business income and taxed at 0-22%. There is no wealth tax. The Global Investor Programme (GIP) for residency requires a minimum investment of S$2.5 million, while citizenship requires PR status, at least 2 years of residence, and renunciation of existing citizenship(s). DBS Bank offers its Digital Exchange (DDEx) for crypto trading and custody, with fintech companies like Revolut and Wirex providing additional services. Institutional custody is robust with providers like DBS Bank, Propine, and Anchorage Digital. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) supports DeFi through Project Guardian. The economy is stable with low inflation (around 2-3%) and a reliable banking system, though the cost of living is 25.8% higher than the US, with a family of four spending around S$5,467.10 monthly without rent.'
