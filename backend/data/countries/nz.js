  // Detailed description
  description: 'New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax, but cryptocurrencies are treated as property for tax purposes, with gains from disposal taxed as income at rates from 10.5% to 39% based on income brackets. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings, and no wealth tax exists. Major banks like Kiwibank, ASB, and BNZ allow personal cryptocurrency transactions but restrict services to crypto businesses, particularly those handling third-party transactions. User experiences indicate that ASB and BNZ are more accommodating for personal use. Institutional custody solutions are available through platforms like Independent Reserve and CoinHQ, which offer institutional-grade services with security features. DeFi access is primarily through international platforms like Transak, with no prominent local solutions. The Investor 1 Resident Visa requires a minimum investment of NZ$10 million in approved investments, while citizenship via naturalization necessitates at least 5 years of residency, including at least 1,350 days of physical presence. New Zealand\'s economy is expected to recover gradually in 2025, with inflation trending towards the Reserve Bank\'s target range of 3.0% ±1%. The cost of living is similar to the United States, with a family of four\'s estimated monthly costs around NZD 6,070 without rent.'
