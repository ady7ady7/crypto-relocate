    // Detailed description
    description: 'Malta does not impose capital gains tax on long-term cryptocurrency holdings (over 365 days), while short-term gains (under 365 days) are taxed at 28%. Professional traders face business income tax rates of 14.5-53%. There is no wealth tax. Residency through the Malta Permanent Residence Programme (MPRP) requires a minimum investment of €300,000 for property in the South of Malta or Gozo, or €350,000 elsewhere, with minimal physical presence needed (7 days/year on average) and processing takes 4-6 months. Citizenship involves 12-36 months of residency with investment (€600,000-€750,000) and takes 7-18 months to process. Banks like Malta Crypto Bank offer crypto services, with institutional custody available under the Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) Act. The economy is stable, with inflation projections at 2.5% (2024), 2.2% (2025), and 2.0% (2026), and the cost of living is 22.5% lower than the US.'
