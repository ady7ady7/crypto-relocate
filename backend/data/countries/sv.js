    // Detailed description
    description: 'El Salvador does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, as per the Bitcoin Law. The Freedom Visa Program requires a $1 million investment in Bitcoin or USDT, with minimal physical presence, taking up to six weeks to process. Citizenship can be expedited with Bitcoin donations (no minimum specified) or through a $1 million investment, taking several months. Banks like Bancoagricola offer Bitcoin services for loans and credit cards, while BANDESAL handles USD to Bitcoin conversions. In January 2025, El Salvador modified its Bitcoin law in alignment with IMF requirements, with changes taking effect May 1, 2025. Businesses are no longer obligated to accept Bitcoin as payment, and it cannot be used to pay taxes or state bills. Despite these changes, El Salvador continues to hold 6,102 Bitcoin (approximately $500 million) in its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund. The cost of living is 41.9% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around $1,000-$2,000 monthly without rent.'
