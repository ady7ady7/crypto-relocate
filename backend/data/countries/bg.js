  // Detailed description
  description: 'Bulgaria offers a straightforward tax system with a flat 10% rate applying to most forms of income, including capital gains from cryptocurrencies. This simplicity extends to crypto taxation, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. There is no wealth tax, making it attractive for crypto investors. Traditional banks like UBB and UniCredit Bulbank are generally not supportive of crypto, with historical account closures for crypto exchanges in 2017, but fintechs like Revolut and Advcash offer crypto-friendly services. Institutional custody is facilitated through licensed VASPs, while DeFi integration is still developing, with ChangeX being a notable local initiative. Residency can be obtained through investment of BGN 500,000 in a Bulgarian company or BGN 1,000,000 in government bonds, granting permanent residency. Citizenship requires 5 years of permanent residency after investment, with physical presence, language proficiency, and good character. The economy is stable with GDP growth of 2.4% in 2024 and predictions of 3% for 2025, with inflation expected to normalize at 2.3% by early 2025.'
