  // Detailed description
  description: 'Thailand imposes a 15% withholding tax on cryptocurrency gains, but transactions through SEC-approved exchanges may be exempt. There are additional income tax obligations of 0-35% for individuals. An exemption for profit-sharing or benefits from holding investment tokens is effective from January 1, 2024. There is no wealth tax. The Elite Visa program offers 5-20 year residency options starting at THB 900k ($25k) for 5 years, with no minimum stay requirement and processing typically taking 3-4 months. Citizenship requires 5 years of residence (3 if married to a Thai), Thai language proficiency, and an income of at least 40,000 THB/month, with a lengthy application process. Banks like Bangkok Bank and Siam Commercial Bank allow transfers to licensed exchanges such as Bitkub and Satang, which provide trading and custody services under SEC regulation. The DeFi market is projected to reach US$205.40m by 2028. The economy is expected to grow 2.7%-2.9% in 2025, with inflation at 1.1%. The cost of living is low compared to the US, with a single person spending $600-$800 monthly without rent. A recent development is a cryptocurrency sandbox being established in Phuket by October 2025.'
