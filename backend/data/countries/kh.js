  // Detailed description
  description: 'Cambodia imposes a 20% capital gains tax on crypto profits, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. Mining income is taxed at 20% for corporations and progressive rates up to 20% for individuals. Gains must be reported on Form N° 692 by March 31 annually. The Prakas on Cryptoassets issued in December 2024 permits crypto transactions but excludes unbacked assets like Bitcoin. Traditional banks are prohibited from crypto transactions under Notice BG/GOV/SEC/2025/07, though third-party solutions like Binance P2P and Paxful facilitate KHR↔crypto conversions. There are no regulated custody providers or DeFi-specific laws in Cambodia, with general AML rules applying to decentralized protocols. Foreign nationals seeking residency typically require a business investment of around $100k, though this threshold is informal. Processing takes 60-90 days via the Ministry of Interior. Citizenship requires 7 years of continuous residence, Khmer language proficiency, and renunciation of original citizenship unless dual citizenship is permitted by the country of origin. The economy is growing steadily at 5.4% in 2024, driven by manufacturing and tourism, with inflation at 4.2% in January 2025. The cost of living is low, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center costing $400-600 per month and meals at inexpensive restaurants around $3-5. Cambodia\'s Central Bank issued draft guidelines in 2024 to classify certain crypto assets as "digital assets" under AML/CFT rules, though tax specifics remain unchanged.'
