  // Detailed description
  description: 'Kazakhstan imposes a corporate income tax of 20% on profits from cryptocurrency transactions for registered entities. Securities are subject to 15% on disposals unless exempt, while real estate is not taxed if proceeds are reinvested within 2 years. For individuals, cryptocurrency gains are taxed at 10% for foreign-issued digital assets or 15% for other crypto disposals, treated as capital gains. Mining operations face a KZT 1 ($0.0023) per kWh energy tax, with mining rewards taxed as corporate income (20%) or individual income (10-15%). The Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) offers a significant advantage with 0% corporate tax for licensed crypto firms, allowing exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Bitfinex to operate under AIFC licenses. Traditional banks prohibit direct crypto transactions under AML policies, though AIFC entities enable compliant AMDâ†”crypto conversions. There are no domestic custody providers, but Fireblocks and Coinbase are accessible via AIFC subsidiaries. Kazakhstan ranks second globally in Bitcoin mining, contributing 18% of the global hashrate as of 2023, with energy subsidies for registered miners. Residency requires an AIFC Business License with $100 share capital and a mandatory office in the AIFC, or standard residency requiring 183+ days/year for tax purposes. Citizenship requires 5+ years of continuous residence, basic Kazakh proficiency, and renunciation of prior citizenship unless permitted. The economy is projected to grow by 4.7% in 2025, with inflation expected to remain above the 5% target until late 2026.'
