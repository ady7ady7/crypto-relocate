  // Detailed description
  description: 'Liechtenstein offers tax advantages for cryptocurrency investors, with no capital gains tax for individuals on cryptocurrency profits due to the treatment of speculative profits as tax-free. Security tokens enjoy tax-free status as Liechtenstein law does not have capital gains tax on profits from trading with participations. For legal entities, profits are subject to a 12.5% corporate tax rate, reducible to 8.5%. Wealth tax is integrated into income tax at 0.8-0.96%. Residency is restrictive with limited permits, requiring substantial funds (CHF 1M+) and health insurance, with processing taking at least four weeks for EEA/Swiss nationals. Citizenship requires 30 years of residence (10 if married to a Liechtensteiner), German language proficiency, and community vote, followed by approval from Parliament and the Prince. Banks like Bank Frick and LGT Bank offer cryptocurrency services, while institutions like Copper provide custody solutions under the Blockchain Act (TVTG), which creates a comprehensive legal framework for the token economy. The economy is stable with low inflation (1-2%), but the cost of living is 48.1% higher than the US, with a family of four spending around CHF 6,130 without rent, and rent at CHF 1,500-2,000 for a city-center one-bedroom apartment.'
