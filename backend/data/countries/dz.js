  // Detailed description
  description: 'Algeria imposes a 15% capital gains tax for residents and 20% for non-residents on assets like real property and shares, with exemptions for first homes and SPSE-listed shares. However, cryptocurrency is illegal under the 2018 Financial Law, prohibiting purchase, sale, use, and possession, making tax reporting not applicable. The 2025 Finance Law introduced a 5% tax rate on capital gains reinvested in shares or equity interests, with a 25% penalty for non-compliance, though this doesn\'t apply to crypto due to its illegal status. Due to the ban, there are no banking services, crypto-friendly banks, institutional custody solutions, or DeFi integration in Algeria. The Central Bank prohibits banks from facilitating crypto transactions under the 2018 Finance Law and Exchange Control Act, while the government focuses on Bokolo Cash, a mobile payment system and CBDC launched in January 2025 for digital financial inclusion. Algeria has a wealth tax on assets exceeding DZD 100 million, with rates up to 1.5% for residents on worldwide assets and non-residents on Algerian property. Residency requires a long-term visa for stays over 90 days, with no specific investment needed, and documentation includes a valid passport, proof of address, and police clearance. Citizenship is obtained through birth to an Algerian parent or naturalization after 7 years of residence, with requirements including good character and assimilation into society. Dual citizenship is not recognized, requiring renunciation of previous citizenship.'
