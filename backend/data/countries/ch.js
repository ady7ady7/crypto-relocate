    // Detailed description
    description: 'Switzerland does not impose capital gains tax on private investors for movable assets like stocks and cryptocurrency, but professional traders face business income tax rates of up to 7.8% plus social security contributions. A wealth tax of 0.02-1.03% applies at cantonal and municipal levels. Residency requires sufficient financial means through lump-sum taxation (CHF 450k-2M), with no direct investment needed, and processing can take weeks to months depending on the canton. Citizenship typically requires 10 years of residence, with language and integration tests. Several Swiss banks offer crypto services, including Bitcoin Suisse and Gazprombank Switzerland, with robust institutional custody solutions. The economy is stable with low inflation (0-2% target) and a reliable banking system, though the cost of living is 54.4% higher than the US.'
