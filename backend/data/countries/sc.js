  // Detailed description
  description: 'Seychelles does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. Offshore entities like International Business Companies (IBCs) benefit from tax exemption on activities conducted outside Seychelles. There is no wealth tax. Residency is relatively accessible with a $2,000 deposit plus proof of income, with no minimum physical presence requirement, and processing taking 3-12 months. Citizenship requires at least 5 years of permanent residency or exceptional contributions, with proficiency in English, French, or Creole, taking several months to a year to process. Traditional banks may not directly support cryptocurrency, but specialized service providers work with banks that accept Seychelles IBCs and facilitate crypto-related transactions. Major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, KuCoin, and OKX have established a legal presence in Seychelles, attracted by the favorable regulatory landscape. The economy has made significant progress since the 2008 crisis, but remains vulnerable to external shocks, with deflation recorded in 2023 (-1.0%) and contained price growth at an average of 1.0% over 2024. The cost of living is moderate, with monthly expenses for a single person around $974.9 without rent.'
