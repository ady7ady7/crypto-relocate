  // Detailed description
  description: 'The Czech Republic offers a favorable tax environment for crypto investors with no wealth tax and a significant tax advantage for holdings over 3 years. As of January 2025, capital gains on crypto assets held longer than 3 years are tax-exempt, and transactions under CZK 100,000 (~USD 4,136) do not require reporting. Short-term holdings are taxed at personal income tax rates of 15% to 23%. Max banka (formerly Expobank CZ) was known for offering crypto-friendly services, though its current status is unclear post-acquisition. Traditional banks are generally not crypto-friendly. Institutional custody is available through licensed VASPs, though specific providers are not widely listed. DeFi integration is limited, with users relying on global platforms like OKX. Residency requires 183 days of presence or a permanent home, while citizenship via naturalization takes 5 years of permanent residence and renouncing prior citizenship (unless an EU citizen). The economy is stable with GDP growth of 2.4% in 2024 and predictions of 3% for 2025, with inflation expected to normalize at 2.3% by early 2025.'
