  // Detailed description
  description: 'Uganda does not have a separate capital gains tax; instead, it taxes capital gains as part of business income. For corporations, capital gains are taxed at the standard 30% rate, while individuals face progressive rates from 0% to 40% based on income brackets. For cryptocurrency transactions, Uganda applies a 10% tax on purchases from non-residents, with no wealth tax. Tax reporting is mandatory for crypto transactions by June 30 annually, with no distinction between short-term and long-term holdings. Traditional banks are restricted from facilitating crypto transactions under Bank of Uganda directives, though third-party platforms like Binance P2P and Paxful enable UGXâ†”crypto conversions. A 10% withholding tax applies to commissions paid to payment service providers. There are no domestic custodians, institutional custody solutions, or DeFi-specific laws, though global providers remain accessible. Uganda lacks formal investment-based residency programs, with standard residency requiring documentation including passport, police clearance, and proof of income. Permanent residency requires possession of a Certificate of Residence, which takes about one month to process. Citizenship through naturalization requires 20 years of legal residence, though marriage to a Ugandan citizen can provide an alternative pathway. Dual citizenship is allowed in specific cases. The economy has shown resilience, with GDP growth estimated at 6.3% in 2022 and inflation declining to 3.2% in FY24. The cost of living is low, with a family of four\'s monthly expenses around $1,790 without rent, and a one-bedroom apartment in the city center costing $300-400 monthly.'
