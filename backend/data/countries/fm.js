  // Detailed description
  description: 'In Micronesia, capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, with rates ranging from 6% to 10% for individuals and 21% for corporations, with no distinction between long-term and short-term gains. Cryptocurrencies are likely taxed similarly though no specific laws exist, reported in annual tax returns due by March 31. Traditional banks like Bank of FSM, Bank of Hawaii, and Bank of Guam do not support cryptocurrency transactions, forcing users to rely on international exchanges like Binance and OKX. There are no crypto-friendly banks, institutional custody solutions, or significant DeFi integration due to limited financial infrastructure. Micronesia has no wealth tax, including for cryptocurrencies. Foreigners can stay up to 60 days without a visa, but longer stays require entry permits with processing taking several weeks to months. Citizenship requires five years of residence, competency in one of the country\'s languages, and renunciation of previous citizenship, though dual citizenship is now allowed for Micronesians with parental ties. The economy is heavily reliant on US aid through the Compact of Free Association, with GDP projected to grow by 2.3% in 2025 and inflation typically below 5%. The cost of living is relatively low, with a family of four spending around $3,456.6 per month without rent.'
