  // Detailed description
  description: 'Nigeria imposes a 10% capital gains tax on crypto profits with a 7.5% VAT proposed on service fees. The Central Bank of Nigeria lifted its ban on crypto transactions in December 2023, allowing banks to support Virtual Asset Service Providers under strict AML/KYC regulations. Several banks including Zenith Bank, Kuda Bank, and Rubies Bank now offer crypto-friendly services with partnerships to exchanges. While there are no prominent Nigeria-based institutional crypto custody providers, Nigerians actively use global DeFi platforms with a projected user penetration rate of 0.69% for 2025. There is no wealth tax. Non-Nigerians must obtain a residence permit to stay more than 90 days, with no formal investment-based program but typical thresholds around $100k for business establishment. Citizenship through naturalization requires 15 years of legal residence, while citizenship by registration is available for foreign women married to Nigerian men after meeting requirements. Nigeria ranks second globally in crypto adoption, demonstrating resilience despite historical restrictions. The economy faces challenges with inflation at 24.5% in 2023, though the banking system is reliable with ongoing reforms for financial inclusion and stability.'
