  // Detailed description
  description: 'Germany offers favorable tax treatment for long-term cryptocurrency holders with 0% capital gains tax on assets held for more than one year. Short-term gains (under one year) are taxed at the individual\'s progressive income tax rate of up to 45%, with a €600 tax-free allowance. There is no wealth tax. Residency typically requires a €1 million business investment plus job creation, with processing taking 4-6 months. Citizenship requires 8 years of residence (6 with integration courses), German language proficiency (B1 level), and knowledge of German life and legal system, taking 1-2 years to process. Several banks like N26 and Fidor Bank are crypto-friendly, while traditional institutions like Commerzbank and DZ Bank offer services through partnerships. Deutsche Börse\'s Clearstream will offer custody for Bitcoin and Ethereum starting April 2025. The economy is stable with low inflation (2-3%) and a reliable banking system. The cost of living is 5.4% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around €3,000-€4,000 monthly without rent, and rent at €887 for a city-center one-bedroom.'
