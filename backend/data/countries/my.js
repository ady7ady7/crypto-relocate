  // Detailed description
  description: 'Malaysia currently does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency assets, though there was a proposed 10% capital gains tax on unlisted shares and foreign assets effective January 1, 2024. For active traders, profits may be considered business income subject to income tax rates of 0-30%. Corporate tax rates are 19% (standard) or 8.5% for small businesses. There is no wealth tax. The Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program requires a fixed deposit of RM 1 million ($210,000) for the Silver Tier, with no minimum stay requirement and processing typically taking 2-3 months. Citizenship requires 10 years of residency, Malay language proficiency, and renunciation of other citizenships, taking several years to process. Banks like Maybank, CIMB, and UOB allow transfers to licensed exchanges such as Luno and Tokenize, which are regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia. The DeFi market is projected to reach US$2.2m by 2025. The economy is projected to grow 4.0% in 2024, with moderate inflation. The cost of living is affordable, with a single person\'s monthly expenses around MYR 2,284.9 (USD 515.1) without rent. The Labuan Digital Free Zone offers 0% crypto tax until 2030 with a $10k minimum residency investment.'
