  // Detailed description
  description: 'Bhutan does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions as of March 2025. However, new reforms are being considered with a 2024 Draft Legislation proposing a 5% flat tax on crypto gains, though this remains unapproved. Undisclosed crypto holdings discovered in audits may face 60% penalties under a Section 158B Amendment. Traditional banks in Bhutan block crypto transactions under AML policies, with no crypto wallets or banking integration available. Users rely on offshore platforms like Binance P2P and VPNs for crypto access. Bit2Me facilitates EUR/Nu. conversions while Bitdeer partners with Druk Holding & Investments (DHI) to leverage Bhutan\'s 600 MW hydropower facilities for institutional mining. DHI holds 13,029 BTC ($780M) in cold storage as of September 2024. The country is exploring a blockchain-based self-sovereign identity system for citizens and the Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) plans to integrate BTC/ETH/BNB into strategic reserves. Bhutan imposes no wealth tax, including on crypto holdings. Temporary residency is granted for work, study, or family reunification, though there are no investment-based programs. Citizenship requires 5+ years of residence, basic Dzongkha proficiency, and renunciation of other citizenships. The economy shows 4.6% GDP growth with 4.2% inflation, with risks including seasonal hydropower shortages affecting mining operations and market volatility impacting reserves.'
