  // Detailed description
  description: 'Russia\'s cryptocurrency tax regime, effective January 1, 2025, is defined by Federal Law No. 418FZ. Individuals pay 13% on crypto gains up to 2.4M RUB/year and 15% on amounts exceeding this threshold. Taxable events include selling crypto for RUB, crypto-to-crypto swaps, and mining/staking rewards (treated as ordinary income). FIFO methodology is mandatory, and losses from crypto cannot offset gains from other assets. Corporations pay 25% on mining (market value at receipt) and 20-25% on sales profits. The 2025 law creates a single tax base combining crypto and securities gains (Article 210.6) with penalties of 40K RUB for non-compliance. The Central Bank prohibits RUB transactions via crypto except for the CBDC pilot for cross-border trade. No Russian banks provide crypto services, forcing users to rely on Binance P2P (requiring VPNs due to EU sanctions) and domestic exchanges Bynex/Whitebird operating under tax exemptions. The High-Technology Park (HTP) provides a tax haven for registered entities, avoiding VAT and corporate tax. Institutional custody is managed by the National Settlement Depository (NSD) under Central Bank oversight. DeFi protocols must adhere to AML/KYC rules under FATF guidelines. Russia imposes no wealth tax, with crypto holdings taxed only upon disposal. Work visas require employment contracts with minimum 70K RUB/month salary. The economy shows 1.5% GDP growth with 6.8% inflation, while crypto faces risks from EU sanctions limiting access to global liquidity.'
