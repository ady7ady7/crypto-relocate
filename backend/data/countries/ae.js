    // Detailed description
    description: 'The UAE offers 0% tax on all cryptocurrency transactions with no capital gains or wealth tax. The Golden Visa requires a minimum investment of AED 2 million (approximately â‚¬970,000) in real estate or business, with processing typically taking 4-6 months. Several banks, including Santander Totta and Millennium BCP, offer crypto-friendly services, with institutional custody solutions available. The UAE positions itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, with the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) providing comprehensive regulatory frameworks. The cost of living is 16.3% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around $3,495 monthly without rent. The economy is stable with low inflation (around 2-3%) and a reliable banking system, posing low risks for cryptocurrency activities.'
