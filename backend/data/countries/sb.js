  // Detailed description
  description: 'The Solomon Islands does not have explicit cryptocurrency tax regulations. Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains accounted for 27.63% of total revenue in 2022, according to World Bank data. However, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) declares cryptocurrencies non-legal tender and warns against their use due to volatility and illicit risks. Since crypto transactions are effectively prohibited, taxation becomes moot. The CBSI prohibits financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions, citing risks like money laundering and tax evasion. The government is instead piloting Bokolo Cash, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pegged 1:1 to the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD). Users attempting to access crypto must rely on third-party platforms like Binance P2P, Bybit, and KuCoin via VPNs, but these are unregulated and risky. Licensed brokers like Interactive Brokers, MultiBank, and Oanda offer crypto trading but lack local compliance. No Solomon Islands banks support crypto transactions, with 80% of transactions being cash-based and manual cheque clearing still common. There are no licensed crypto custodians, DeFi-specific laws, or consumer protections for smart contracts. The Solomon Islands imposes no wealth tax on crypto holdings. A potential Citizenship by Investment (CBI) program may launch in 2025, with details unconfirmed but possibly mirroring Caribbean programs (e.g., $100k+ donations). Citizenship currently requires 5+ continuous years of residency and basic English proficiency (24.2% speak English), with mandatory renunciation of other citizenships. The economy is reliant on tourism and agriculture, with crypto making no contribution to GDP.'
