  // Detailed description
  description: 'Ireland applies a 33% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency gains, with a potential exemption for assets held over 3 years under certain conditions. There is a €1,270 annual exemption for all capital gains. There is no wealth tax. Traditional banks like Bank of Ireland and AIB are generally not openly supportive of crypto transactions, though some fintechs and international services offer alternatives. Institutional custody solutions for cryptocurrencies are available through global providers like Coinbase Custody, Anchorage, and BitGo. DeFi integration is limited locally, with access primarily through international platforms. Residency options include the Immigrant Investor Programme, which has been terminated as of 2024 but previously required investments of €500K-€2M. Alternative pathways include the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (€50K+ investment) or philanthropic endowment (€500K donation). Citizenship via naturalization requires 5 years of residence out of the last 9 years, including one continuous year before application, with knowledge of English/Irish and good character. The economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2025, with inflation projected at the same rate. The cost of living is substantial, particularly in Dublin, with housing among the most significant expenses.'
