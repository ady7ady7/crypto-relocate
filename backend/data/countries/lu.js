  // Detailed description
  description: 'Luxembourg applies a 20% standard capital gains tax on crypto gains, with short-term gains (assets held for less than 6 months) taxed at progressive rates from 0% to 45.78% if total capital gains exceed EUR 500. Long-term gains (assets held for more than 6 months) are generally exempt from taxation. There is no wealth tax for individuals since 2006, though companies face a net wealth tax of 0.5% on net assets up to EUR 500 million and 0.05% on amounts exceeding that. In the banking sector, BIL, Spuerkeess, and Standard Chartered are considered crypto-friendly, with Standard Chartered launching a Luxembourg entity in January 2025 for digital asset custody services. Residency requires investment (Golden Visa requires EUR 20 million) or work permits, with 5 years of continuous residence for long-term status. Citizenship requires 5 years of legal residence, good character, knowledge of Luxembourgish language, and passing a test on Luxembourg history and culture. The economy is projected to grow 2.3% in 2025, with inflation expected to reach 2.6%. Public transport is free, a significant benefit reducing living costs.'
