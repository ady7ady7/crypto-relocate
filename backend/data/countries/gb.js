  // Detailed description
  description: 'The UK taxes capital gains on cryptocurrencies at 10-20% (18% for basic rate taxpayers, 24% for higher rate from October 2024), with a £3,000 annual exempt amount for 2024-2025. There is no wealth tax. Traditional banks like Barclays and Lloyds have historically been cautious with crypto transactions, while fintechs like Revolut and Cash App offer crypto-friendly services, including trading and custody. Institutional custody is provided by global services like Coinbase Custody, Anchorage, BitGo, and Gemini Custody. DeFi integration is growing, with increased adoption and access to global platforms like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. Residency typically requires 5 years of continuous residence with indefinite leave to remain and limited absences, while citizenship via naturalization takes 5 years (or 3 if married to a British citizen), requiring good character, English proficiency, and passing the Life in the UK test. The economy is projected to grow by 1.8% in 2025, with inflation stabilizing around 2% by the end of 2025. The cost of living is 5.5% lower than the US (excluding rent), but London remains one of Europe\'s most expensive cities.'
