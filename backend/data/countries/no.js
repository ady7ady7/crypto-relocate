  // Detailed description
  description: 'Norway taxes cryptocurrency gains at a flat rate of 22%, with no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. Reporting is required on Form RF1159 by April 30 annually, using the FIFO method for cost basis calculation. Additionally, a wealth tax of 0.85% applies to net wealth exceeding NOK 1.7 million for individuals (NOK 3.4 million for couples), with crypto assets assessed at their January 1 market rates. Traditional banks like DNB and Nordea block direct crypto transactions due to AML concerns, though Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) is regulated by Finanstilsynet and offers NOKâ†”crypto conversions. Institutional custody services are accessible through global providers like BitGo and Fireblocks, as Norway lacks domestic custodians. DeFi protocols must implement KYC/AML verification by June 2026 under MiCA compliance, impacting anonymous wallet transactions. Norway has no formal investment-based residency program, but standard residency requires a work visa with employment contract and minimum salary of NOK 246,136 annually. Citizenship requires 7+ continuous years of residence (reduced to 5 for Nordic citizens), B1 Norwegian language proficiency, and renunciation of original citizenship unless dual citizenship is permitted. The economy is growing at 1.2% in 2025, with 3% inflation and 3.8% unemployment. The cost of living is 14.6% higher than the United States, with Oslo among Europe\'s most expensive cities.'
