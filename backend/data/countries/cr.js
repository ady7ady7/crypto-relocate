  // Detailed description
  description: 'Costa Rica applies a territorial taxation system, exempting foreign-source income from capital gains tax, including cryptocurrency gains from non-local sources. Local crypto transactions are subject to 15% capital gains tax for individuals, while business-related activities may face corporate tax rates of up to 30%. There is no wealth tax. Residency options include the Rentista program (requiring $2,500/month income for 24 months), Pensionado (requiring $1,000/month pension), and Inversionista (requiring $150,000 investment in real estate or business), with annual visits required and processing taking weeks to months. Citizenship requires 7 years of legal residency (5 for Central American citizens), Spanish language proficiency, passing a test on Costa Rican history and values, and takes several months to a year to process. In February 2025, Banco Nacional launched a spot Bitcoin ETF through its investment arm, BN Fondos, marking the first crypto investment product available through the traditional banking system with a minimum investment of $100. The economy is steadily growing, with 5.1% GDP growth in 2023 and controlled inflation. The cost of living is 32.8% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around $2,500-$3,500 monthly without rent, and rent at $600-$800 for a city-center one-bedroom apartment.'
