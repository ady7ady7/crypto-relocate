  // Detailed description
  description: 'Spain taxes cryptocurrency gains under Income Savings Tax with progressive rates: 19% on gains ≤€6,000, 21% on €6,001-€50,000, 23% on €50,001-€200,000, 26% on €200,001-€300,000, and 28% on gains >€300,000. There is no distinction between long-term and short-term holdings. Mining and staking rewards are taxed as ordinary income at rates up to 47% including regional surcharges, with mandatory FIFO accounting for cost basis calculation. Spain also imposes a wealth tax on net assets exceeding €700,000, with rates from 0.16% to 3.5%, though this varies by region with Madrid offering a 0% rate. BBVA will be the first bank to offer Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody services in 2025 under CNMV approval, while CaixaBank and Kutxabank are expected to follow with similar services by Q3 2025. Spain\'s Golden Visa program, requiring €500,000 real estate investment, is being phased out by April 2025, though existing holders will be unaffected. The Digital Nomad Visa offers an alternative, requiring €2,762/month income (€3,318 with dependents). Citizenship requires 10 years of continuous residence, reduced to 2 years for Ibero-American nationals, with DELE B1 Spanish proficiency. The economy is growing robustly at 3.0% in 2024, with inflation projected to decline to 2.0% by 2026.'
