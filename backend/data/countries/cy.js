  // Detailed description
  description: 'Cyprus offers 0% capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies held as investments for over 1 year, while short-term gains (under 1 year) are taxed at 20%. If trading is deemed business activity, it may be subject to income tax rates of up to 35% for individuals or 12.5% for companies. There is no wealth tax. Residency through investment requires a minimum of €300,000 in real estate, with minimal physical presence (only a visit every 2 years) and processing takes 2-3 months. Citizenship involves 8 years of residency, including a 12-month continuous stay before applying, Greek language proficiency (B1 level), and knowledge of Cyprus\'s socio-political realities, taking several months to years to process. Traditional banks like Hellenic Bank are cautious with crypto, but fintech platforms like Striga and Revolut offer crypto-friendly services. Institutional custody is primarily provided through global partnerships, such as Deutsche Bank\'s collaboration with Taurus. The economy is stable with GDP growth at 2.8% in 2025 and inflation at 2-3%. The cost of living is 18.9% lower than the US, with a family of four spending around €3,392 monthly without rent, and rent at €943 for a city-center one-bedroom.'
