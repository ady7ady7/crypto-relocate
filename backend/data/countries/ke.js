  // Detailed description
  description: 'Kenya applies a 3% Digital Asset Tax (DAT) on the transaction value of cryptocurrencies, effective from September 1, 2023, collected and remitted by platform owners or facilitators to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). Additionally, cryptocurrencies may be subject to Capital Gains Tax at 15% if classified as property. The KRA is implementing a real-time tax system to track crypto transactions, enhancing tax collection efficiency. Banking services for crypto remain limited, with no banks explicitly marketed as crypto-friendly, though some allow transfers to exchanges. Global custody providers like Coinbase and Anchorage offer services that could be accessed by Kenyan users. DeFi adoption is growing, with Kenya ranking fifth globally in crypto adoption (8.5% of the population). There is no wealth tax. Permanent residency requires a work permit for at least 7 years and 3 years of continuous residence preceding the application, while citizenship through naturalization requires 7 years of residency, good character, and language proficiency. The economy is expected to grow by 5.7% in 2025, though political risks remain elevated, particularly during discussions of the 2025 Finance Bill. The cost of living is 56.6% lower than in the United States, making Kenya attractive for expats and crypto users seeking affordability.'
