  // Detailed description
  description: 'Fiji imposes a 10% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on profits from the disposal of capital assets under the Income Tax Act 2015. However, cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, and transactions are prohibited as stated in a 2023 report by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) prohibits banks and payment institutions from facilitating crypto transactions under the RBF Act 1983 and Exchange Control Act 1950. There are no Fijian banks offering crypto services, with the Bank of South Pacific explicitly prohibiting VISA cardholders from performing cryptocurrency transactions. Users attempt to access international platforms like Binance P2P, Bybit, and KuCoin via VPNs but risk penalties under the RBF Act. The country lacks domestic custodians and DeFi-specific regulations, with all crypto activities falling under the general prohibition. Fiji imposes no wealth tax, including on crypto holdings. A 7-year investor permit requires a minimum investment of F$250,000 (approximately $115,000 USD) into the local economy, while a 3-year permit requires F$50,000 in approved projects. For citizenship, at least five of the last ten years must be spent in Fiji, with additional requirements including application form, birth certificate, marriage certificate (if applicable), police clearance certificates, and proof of language proficiency (English, Hindi, or Fijian). The economy is recovering post-pandemic, with GDP growth projected at 3% for 2024 and inflation forecasted at 5% for 2024 and 2.6% for 2025. The cost of living is 50.6% lower than the United States, with rent 62.2% lower, making Fiji an affordable destination despite its crypto prohibition.'
