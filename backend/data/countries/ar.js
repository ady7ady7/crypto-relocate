  // Detailed description
  description: 'Argentina offers 0% crypto tax if declared by March 31, 2025, with 5-15% on international transfers thereafter. No formal investment visa exists, but passive income proof (ARS 30,000/month) or $100k+ informal thresholds provide tax stability. Buenos Aires ranks 3rd in South American financial hubs. Despite favorable current tax treatment, Argentina\'s economic instability and potential policy shifts present significant risks.'
