  // Detailed description
  description: 'Nauru does not have specific regulations or taxes for cryptocurrencies, placing them in a legal gray area. There is no capital gains tax, though if cryptocurrency activities were reported, they might be taxed under general income tax at a flat 10% rate. The banking system is severely limited, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia only committing to provide services as of December 2024, following Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\'s planned exit. No banks offer cryptocurrency services. There are no institutional custody solutions or DeFi integrations available locally. The Nauru Economic & Climate Resilience Citizenship Program, launched in 2025, offers a pathway to citizenship with a contribution starting at $105,000 and no physical presence requirements, processed in 3-4 months. Traditional citizenship through naturalization typically requires seven years of residence. The economy is small and heavily reliant on foreign aid, with historical inflation averaging 1.5% from 2012-2021. The political environment is unstable with frequent leadership changes, and the banking system is unreliable, particularly for cryptocurrency. The cost of living is high relative to infrastructure, with housing at $1,500/month and meals at $15. The lack of financial infrastructure makes Nauru challenging for cryptocurrency operations despite the absence of specific regulations.'
