  // Detailed description
  description: 'Slovenia does not impose capital gains tax on cryptocurrency profits, though mining and staking income is taxed at 25%. In 2022, there was a proposal for a 10% flat tax rate on cryptocurrency transactions with exemptions for those under €15,000 annually, but this remains unconfirmed as of 2025. There is no wealth tax. Residency through business requires a minimum investment of €50,000 plus employment proof, with physical presence required for permanent residency after 5 years, and processing taking a few months. Citizenship through naturalization requires 10 years of residence (5 years if married to a Slovenian citizen), Slovene language proficiency, and community approval, taking several years to process. Banks generally support transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges, though no specific crypto-friendly banks are identified. The institutional custody framework is regulated under national law, but specific providers are not documented. The economy is stable with projected growth of 1-2% in 2025, with inflation above 3.5%. The cost of living is moderate, with monthly expenses for a single person around €800-1000 without rent, and rent at €300-500 for a city-center one-bedroom apartment.'
